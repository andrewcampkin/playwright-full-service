## 📊 **Current Architecture Status**

### **Backend (95% Complete)** ✅
```
✅ Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
✅ Authentication System (JWT + bcrypt)
✅ API Endpoints (User, Project, Website, TestCase management)
✅ AI Service (Playwright + OpenAI integration)
✅ Data Models (Complete schema with relationships)
```

### **Frontend (30% Complete)** 🚧
```
✅ Basic React + TypeScript setup
✅ Tailwind CSS styling
✅ Simple test generation interface
❌ Authentication integration
❌ Project management UI
❌ User dashboard
❌ Test case management
❌ Test execution monitoring
```

### **Missing Critical Components** 🚨
```
❌ Test execution engine (core SaaS functionality)
❌ Real-time monitoring system
❌ Frontend authentication
❌ Project management interface
❌ Test case management interface
```

This roadmap transforms our current foundation into a full-featured SaaS platform. The backend is nearly complete - we just need to build the frontend interfaces and test execution system.
